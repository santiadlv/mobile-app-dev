# Mobile Application Development Class

This repository is aimed at hosting all projects done on this course throughout the year. Each project will have its own folder, with a global .gitignore to leave out Swift-specific runtime files, alongside IDE configuration files.

If you encounter problems runnning any of the tests, make sure to contact me so we can look closely at the issue.
